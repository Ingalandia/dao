# Planning Methodology
We plan to work in a loose agile manner, where we:
1. Identify key issues and work areas.
2. Form deliverables.
2. Allocate time and resources accordingly.
3. Deliver monthly deliverable progress updates.

The goal is to walk the line between concrete planning and ad-hoc maneuvering based on higher priorities.
